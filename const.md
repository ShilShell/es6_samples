# Const (Constant)
This is one of the new features introduced in ES6. Contant are similar to variables and cannot be modified. It's like readonly varible and cannot be reassigned or redeclared. Here is the sample

```javascript
const PI = 3.142;
console.log(PI);//3.142
//PI = 33;//ReferenceError: f is not defined
//const PI = 3;//SyntaxError: Identifier 'PI' has already been declared
```
